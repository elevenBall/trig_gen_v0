trigger generator Max for Live MIDI Effect

Trying to make some sense out of some needs, hope this can also be useful for u <3

We are using this Max patch to control a Drum Rack or a Simpler to cut some juice breaks.



Choose the base octave for the trigs generated, choose the max note number (or slice), choose the probability for the trigs, and play with the velocity "sample and hold" style modulation. Press the push button and a new sequence based on the parameters will be generated.

The toggle its for exploratory works on retrig functionality.



Any suggestion is more than welcome, and in any doubt please write me!

thanks.


versions:
